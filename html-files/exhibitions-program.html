            <h1>Cosmology</h1>
            <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
            <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

    <!-- EXHIBITION EVOLUTION-->
    <section class="exhibitions-two">
        <div class="info-box">
            <h1>Evolution</h1>
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
            <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

            <h1>Biology</h1>
            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
            <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
            <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

            <h1>Robotics</h1>
            <p>Robotics is like the magic behind these robots, where scientists and engineers use their creativity and knowledge to design, build, and program these futuristic machines. It's like a fun puzzle where you get to create your own robot friend and teach it how to do all kinds of tasks.</p>
            <p>Imagine robots as cool, high-tech helpers that can do all sorts of amazing things, just like the robots you see in movies and cartoons. They are like mechanical friends that can move, see, and even think in their own special way.</p>
            <p>Just like how you have different toys for different games, there are different types of robots for different jobs. Some robots help with exploring space, others assist doctors in surgery, and some even play soccer! Robotics is all about using technology to make our lives easier, safer, and more fun.</p>

    <!-- EXHIBITION AI -->
    <section class="exhibtions-six">
        <div class="info-box">
            <h1>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</h1>
            <p>Imagine AI as a super smart friend that lives inside computers and robots, helping them think and learn just like we do! AI is like a digital brain that can solve puzzles, play games, and even chat with you. It's like having a clever buddy who's always ready to help out with tricky tasks.</p>
            <p>AI works by using special algorithms and data to understand the world around it. It can recognize faces in photos, recommend movies you might like, or even drive cars all on its own! Just like how you learn from your experiences, AI learns from the information it gathers to become even smarter.</p>
            <p>Think of AI as a friendly sidekick that's here to make our lives easier and more exciting. From helping scientists discover new things to powering cool video games, AI is like a magical tool that keeps getting better and better at understanding and interacting with the world around us.</p>

            <h1>Ecology</h1>
            <p>Ecology is like a nature puzzle where plants, animals, and the environment all fit together perfectly. It's about how living things interact with each other and their surroundings, creating a beautiful web of life where every piece is important.</p>
            <p>In a forest, trees provide homes for animals, which help plants grow by spreading seeds. This shows how different parts of nature rely on each other in a delicate balance. Ecologists are like nature detectives who study these connections and help us understand how to protect our planet.</p>
            <p>By learning about ecology, we see how our actions, like planting trees and keeping our environment clean, can make a big difference in keeping Earth healthy for all living things. It's like being a superhero for nature, helping to preserve the beauty and balance of our planet for generations to come.</p>

    <!-- EXHIBTIONS DINOSAURS -->
    <section class="exhibtions-eight">
        <div class="info-box">
            <h1>Dinosaur</h1>
            <p>Dinosaurs were amazing creatures that lived on Earth millions of years ago. Imagine a world where these gigantic animals roamed the land, ruled the skies, and swam in the seas. They came in all shapes and sizes, from the massive long-necked Brachiosaurus to the fierce and speedy Velociraptor.</p>
            <p>These ancient beasts were like real-life monsters, but they weren't all scary! Some dinosaurs were gentle plant-eaters, while others were fierce predators with sharp teeth and claws. They had different ways of moving, eating, and protecting themselves, making them a diverse and fascinating group of creatures.</p>
            <p>Scientists study dinosaurs by examining their fossils, which are like ancient puzzles that help us piece together what these creatures looked like and how they lived. Through these discoveries, we've learned so much about the incredible world of dinosaurs and the important role they played in Earth's history.</p>
